# Web Page Analyzer API

## Overview
This is the backend component of the `Web Page Analyzer`. It is tasked with reading tags of a given web page and generate a summary. The service exposes a REST endpoint that accepts a URL and an array of HTML tag names.

The `OpenAPI` document of the RESTful interface can be found [here](https://github.com/kosatnkn/web-page-analyzer-api/blob/main/docs/api/openapi.yaml).

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> There are two more pieces to the solution.
> - Web Page Analyzer Client, the frontend component ([https://github.com/kosatnkn/web-page-analyzer-client](https://github.com/kosatnkn/web-page-analyzer-client))
> - Deployer, the IoC (infrastructure as code) component that enables single command deployment ([https://github.com/kosatnkn/web-page-analyzer-deploy](https://github.com/kosatnkn/web-page-analyzer-deploy))
